  title: Module Skins
  author: BakersDozenBagels
  description: "Allows you to reskin several modules. This mod is highly configurable,
    so each skin can be toggled individually.\r\n\r\nCurrently contains eight skins:\r\n\"Modern\"
    for Colour Flash\r\n\"Rolodex\" for Brainf---\r\n\"USA\" for Simon States\r\n\"WhatHow\"
    for Literally Nothing\r\n\"Hologram\" for The Plunger Button\r\n\"ONE\" for The
    Radio\r\n\"EaTEoT\" for Art Appreciation\n\"HD\" for Yippee\n\r\nThis mod is designed
    to never be beneficial during competitive play (it may be detrimental). The only
    exception to this is in identification of similar-looking modules.\r\n\r\nThis
    mod does not include the original modules, it merely modifies them during gameplay.\r\n\r\nHow
    to use the settings file: Each skin has a weight assigned to it. A skin will be
    randomly chosen per module, with a higher weight being more likely to be chosen.
    Use a weight of 0 to completely disable a skin. The special skin \"$\" represents
    the original unskinned look of the module.\r\n\r\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BakersDozenBagels/KtaneSkins\r\n\r\n\r\nMore
    skins coming soon probably! Feel free to make suggestions, also."
